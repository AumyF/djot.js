# djot.js

This is a typescript rewrite of [djot's
lua implementation](https://github.com/jgm/djot).
It is currently powering the [djot
playground](https://djot.net/playground).

`npm run test` runs some tests.

`npm run build` will generate a single-file library bundle `dist/djot.js`.

## Installing the command line utility

From this source directory, you can install the command-line
utility `djot` thus:

```
npm install -g .
```

`djot --help` will give you some cryptic guidance.  For more
extensive documentation, use `man djot` or see the
[man page online](https://github.com/jgm/djot.js/blob/main/doc/djot.md).
You can use `djot` to

- convert from djot to HTML
- show the low-level event stream generated by the djot parser
- show the AST produced by the djot parser, in JSON or compact form
- convert from a JSON-formatted djot AST to djot or HTML
- alter the AST using filters
- convert from djot to pandoc JSON which can be read by pandoc
- convert pandoc JSON (or djot) to djot

For example, to convert a `gfm` document `mydoc.md` to djot,

```
pandoc mydoc.md -f gfm -t json | djot -f pandoc -t djot > mydoc.dj
```

And to convert back to `gfm`,

```
djot mydoc.dj -t pandoc | pandoc -f json -t gfm
```
